# Prediction of Home Prices

The goal of the "House Price Prediction" project is to forecast home prices through the application of machine learning methods. Using well-known Python modules like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (sklearn), and XGBoost, this project offers a comprehensive solution for precise price estimation.

## Project Synopsis

The goal of the "House Price Prediction" project is to create a model that, utilizing a variety of features, can anticipate house prices with accuracy. In the fields of finance and real estate, this prediction task is crucial since it helps investors, purchasers, and sellers make wise decisions. With the use of carefully chosen datasets and machine learning techniques, this project offers a potent tool for property value estimation.
## Important Elements

- **Data Gathering and Analysis:** The "California Housing" dataset, which is directly downloadable from the Scikit-learn library, is used in this research. Features in the dataset include the age of the house, the number of rooms, the population, and the median income. The data is transformed and processed using Pandas to make sure it is ready for analysis.

**Visualization of Data:** Data visualization techniques are utilized in the project to obtain insights from the dataset. Visualizations like correlation matrices, scatter plots, and histograms are made with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The relationships between features are better understood thanks to these visualizations, which also make trends and patterns easier to spot.

- **Split Training-Test:** The train-test split technique is used in this project to assess the regression model's performance. To make sure the model is trained on some data and tested on untested data, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets. This makes it possible to evaluate the model's predictive power with accuracy.

- **XGBoost Regression Model:** The regression model is constructed by the project using the well-liked gradient boosting framework, the XGBoost algorithm. High prediction accuracy and handling intricate feature interactions are two of XGBoost's well-known strengths. This project makes use of an implementation of XGBoost from the Scikit-learn toolkit.
## Final Thoughts - **Model Assessment:** R-squared error and mean absolute error are two evaluation metrics that are used in the project to gauge how well the regression model performs. While mean absolute error quantifies the average difference between the predicted and actual home prices, R-squared error represents the percentage of the target variable's volatility that can be explained by the model. These measures shed light on the precision and accuracy of the model. To see the projected prices in comparison to the actual prices, a scatter plot is also made.
